## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs in local check.

## Resubmission
This is a resubmission after the initial submission did "not pass the incoming checks automatically". In this version I have:

* Updated the Description to remove perceived spelling errors introduced by listing package names (e.g. ggplot).

* Changed the links for RColorBrewer and colorBlindness packages in the ReadMe to the canonical format https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pkgname

* Added a new entry to the NEWS.md file.
