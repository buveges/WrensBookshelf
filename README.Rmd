This package is a collection of color pallettes that were extracted from various books on my sons(Wren) bookshelf. Also included are a number of functions and wrappers to utilize them in base R and ggplot2 plotting functions, as well as to subset the packages to desired number/specific colors. It was heavily inspired by and modeled after the [MetBrewer](https://github.com/BlakeRMills/MetBrewer), [PNWColors](https://github.com/jakelawlor/PNWColors), and [wesanderson](https://github.com/karthik/wesanderson) packages, and of course [RColorBrewer](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RColorBrewer ), so if you are here you should check them out too! Logo designed using [hexSticker](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/hexSticker) and illustrator.

## Installation

You can install the released version of WrensBookshelf from CRAN using:

```r
install.packages("WrensBookshelf")
```
And the developement version from Github using:

``` r
devtools::install_github("buveges/WrensBookshelf")
```

## Palettes

### All palettes

Can view all palettes from Wren's bookshelf using the  `ShowBookshelf()` function

```{r AllPalettes}
library(WrensBookshelf)
ShowBookshelf()

names(WrensBookshelf)
```

### Color Vision Deficiency (CVD) safe palettes

Can display only CVD safe palettes using `CVDsafe` option. These were determined/assigned by using the amazing `cvdPlot()` function from the [colorBlindness](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=colorBlindness) package, and should be safe for deuteranopia and protanopia, and in many cases when desaturated (BW).

```{r CVDsafe}
ShowBookshelf(CVDsafe = TRUE)
```

### Palettes for Discrete/Continuous data

All palettes can be used for either discrete or continuous data display, however some apply themselves to one better than the other. Use the `BestFor` option  to view palettes that, in my own view, work best for "discrete" or "continuous" variables. This can be combined/stacked with the `CVDsafe` option as well

```{r BestFor}
ShowBookshelf(BestFor = "continuous")

```


## Functions

### ShowBook()

Similar to `ShowBookshelf()` which shows all palettes with given filters, but `ShowBook()` is used to display a single book as a modified plot object.

```{r ShowBook, fig.height=4}
ShowBook(name ="BabyWrenAndTheGreatGift")

```

### WB_brewer()

Select/create palettes from Wren's bookshelf. Can create "discrete" or "continuous" color palettes using the `type` argument.

```{r WBbrewer, out.height="300px"}

WB_brewer("BurtDow")

WB_brewer("Opposites", n = 5, type="discrete")

WB_brewer("GustavoTheShyGhost2", n = 20, type="continuous")

WB_brewer("LittleBlueHouseBesideTheSea1", n = 100, type="continuous")

```


For discrete palettes, I have assigned a specific order that the colors will be selected from a given palette when `n < length(palette)` in order to give the best contrast between discrete variables (in my opinion). This can be removed using `override.order= TRUE`.

```{r OverrideOrder, out.height="300px"}

WB_brewer("TheRunawayBunny", n = 4, type = "discrete", override.order = FALSE)

WB_brewer("TheRunawayBunny", n = 6, type = "discrete", direction = -1, override.order = TRUE)

```

### WB_subset_brewer()

This function is just another way of customizing palettes that I tried building before figuring out a better way to do it. So, this is a relic that still works, and still gives a little more intuitive(to me at least...) or specific control over the final product.

```{r WBsubsetbrewer, out.height="300px"}

WB_subset_brewer(name = "JulienIsAMermaid", n = 5, LCR = "left", type = "continuous", n2 = 200)

```

It also allows for you to select the exact subset of colors you want from a palette by providing a vector of the colors positions (Left to Right) as shown by `ShowBookshelf()` or `ShowBook()` to the `LCR` argument. The vector you provide can also shuffle around the order of the colors to best suit your preferences.

```{r WBsubsetbrewerVector, out.height="300px"}

WB_subset_brewer(name = "WhereTheWildThingsAre", type = "discrete", LCR = c(1,6,4,5))

```

### ggplot wrapper functions

Some convenience functions to make integration of palettes into ggplot2 easier. 

``` {r ggplotWrappers}

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = disp, y = wt, color = factor(cyl)))+
  geom_point(size = 5)+
  scale_color_WB_d(name = "YouMatter")+
  theme_bw()

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = disp,y = wt, fill= mpg))+
     geom_point(size=5, shape = 21)+
     scale_fill_WB_c(name = "ThisMooseBelongsToMe", direction = -1)+
     theme_bw()


ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price, fill = color))+
  geom_density(position="stack", color = "white")+
  scale_fill_WB_d("CapsForSale", override.order = TRUE)+
  theme_classic()

```

Can also simply utilize `WB_brewer()` within the normal ggplot2 scale functions.

``` {r ggplot}

library(usmap)
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)
statepop2 <- statepop %>% 
  mutate(logPop = log(pop_2015, base = 10))
plot_usmap(data = statepop2, 
           values = "logPop",
           regions = "states", 
           color = "white") + 
  labs(title = "State Populations",
       subtitle = expression('Population by state for the year 2015 on a'~'log'[10]~'scale'),
       fill = expression('log'[10]~'(Population)')) + 
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = WB_brewer("WhatWellBuild"))+
  theme(panel.background=element_blank(),
        legend.position = c(0.6,0.01),
        legend.direction = "horizontal")

ggplot(data.frame(x = rnorm(10000), y = rnorm(10000)),aes(x=x,y=y))+
  stat_density_2d(aes(fill = ..level..), geom = "polygon", colour="white")+
  scale_fill_WB_c("TinyPerfectThings",direction = -1)+
  theme_void()

```
