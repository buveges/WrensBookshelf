# WrensBookshelf

<!-- badges: start -->
:::: {style="display: flex;"}


::: {}

This package is a collection of color pallettes that were extracted from various books on my sons(Wren) bookshelf. Also included are a number of functions and wrappers to utilize them in baseR and ggplot2 plotting functions, as well as to subset the packages to desired number/specific colors. It was heavily inspired by and modeled after the [MetBrewer](https://github.com/BlakeRMills/MetBrewer) and [wesanderson](https://github.com/karthik/wesanderson) packages.

## Installation

You can install the released version of WrensBookshelf from 

``` r
devtools::install_github("buveges/WrensBookshelf")
```

## Palettes

### All palettes

Can view all palettes from Wren's bookshelf using the  `ShowBookshelf()` function

```{r AllPalettes}
library(WrensBookshelf)
ShowBookshelf()

names(WrensBookshelf)
```

### Color Vision Deficiency (CVD) safe palettes

Can display only CVD safe palettes using `CVDsafe` option.

```{r CVDsafe}
ShowBookshelf(CVDsafe = TRUE)
```

### Palettes for Discrete/Continuous data

All palettes can be used for either discrete or continuous data display, however some apply themselves to one better than the other. Use the `BestFor` option  to view palettes that, in my own view, work best for "discrete" or "continuous" variables. This can be combined/stacked with the `CVDsafe` option as well

```{r BestFor}
ShowBookshelf(BestFor = "continuous")

```


## Functions

### ShowBook()

Similar to `ShowBookshellf()` which shows all palettes with given filters, but `ShowBook()` used to display a single book as a modified plot object.

```{r ShowBook}
ShowBook(name ="BabyWrenAndTheGreatGift")

```

### WB_brewer()

Select/create palettes from Wren's bookshelf.

```{r WBbrewer}

WB_brewer("BurtDow")

WB_brewer("CapsForSale", n = 5, direction = 1, override.order = FALSE, type="discrete")

WB_brewer("GustavoTheShyGhostGraveyard", n = 20,type="continuous")

WB_brewer("LittleBlueHouseBesideTheSeaCont",100,type="continuous")

```
### WB_subset_brewer()

This function is just another way of customizing palettes that I found gives a little more intuitive control over the final product.

```{r WBsubsetbrewer}

WB_subset_brewer(name = "WhereTheWildThingsAre", type = "discrete", LCR = c(1,4,5,6))

WB_subset_brewer(name = "JulienIsAMermaid", n = 5, LCR = "left", type = "continuous", n2 = 200)

```

### ggplot wrapper functions

Some convenience functions to make integration of palettes into ggplot2 easier. 

``` {r ggplotWrappers}

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = disp, y = wt, color = factor(cyl)))+
  geom_point(size = 5)+
  scale_color_WB_d(name = "YouMatter")+
  theme_bw()

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = disp,y = wt, fill= mpg))+
     geom_point(size=5, shape = 21)+
     scale_fill_WB_c(name = "BabyBeluga", direction = -1)+
     theme_bw()

df <- expand.grid(x = 1:25, y = 1:25)
vec <- c(seq(1:312), seq(313:1))
df <- cbind(df,vec)

ggplot(df, aes(x = x,y = y,fill = vec))+
  geom_tile()+
  scale_fill_WB_c("WhatWellBuild")+
  theme_void()

```

Can also simply utilize `WB_brewer()` within the normal ggplot2 scale functions.

``` {r ggplot}

df <- expand.grid(x = 1:25, y = 1:25)
vec <- c(seq(1:312), seq(313:1))
df <- cbind(df,vec)

ggplot(df, aes(x = x,y = y,fill = vec))+
  geom_tile()+
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = WB_brewer("Vampenguin"))+
  theme_void()

```
